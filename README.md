# React Native FlatList Asynchronous Data Fetching and Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with asynchronous data fetching and updates within a FlatList component in React Native.  The issue arises from attempting to directly update the component's state within the `renderItem` method, which can lead to inconsistent rendering and unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains a React Native component that fetches data asynchronously and attempts to render it within a FlatList. However, due to the asynchronous nature of data fetching, the `renderItem` method might try to access the state before the data has been completely fetched, leading to errors or inconsistencies in the displayed data.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected implementation that addresses the problem by properly handling asynchronous operations and ensuring that data is available before attempting to render it.  This is achieved by using appropriate state management techniques and handling loading states.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the app on your device or emulator.
4. Observe the inconsistent rendering in `bug.js` and the improved rendering in `bugSolution.js`.
